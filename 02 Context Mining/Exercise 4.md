# Context Mining Exercise: Diving Deeper into Context

## Step 1: Start with Your Original Prompt
Take the prompt you created in the first exercise and identify what context you already included.

**Example - Original Product Description Prompt:**
```
Task: Write a product description for our new wireless earbuds.

Context: I work for a mid-range electronics company targeting busy professionals aged 25-40. Our earbuds cost $89, have 8-hour battery life, active noise cancellation, and quick-charge features. Our main competitors are Apple AirPods ($179) and Samsung Galaxy Buds ($149).

## Step 2: Apply the Context Mining Framework

Go through each category systematically to identify missing context:

### üè¢ Situational Background
**Ask yourself:** What's the broader situation driving this need?

**Current context:** "I work for a mid-range electronics company"
**Missing context to add:** 
- Why are we launching this product now?
- What market opportunity are we addressing?
- What's happening in our industry?

### üë• Who's Involved  
**Ask yourself:** Who are all the stakeholders and decision-makers?

**Current context:** "targeting busy professionals aged 25-40"
**Missing context to add:**
- Who will review/approve this description?
- What do our current customers say about our brand?
- Who else will use this content?

### üìã Parameters and Constraints
**Ask yourself:** What limitations or requirements haven't I mentioned?

**Current context:** "cost $89" and competitor pricing
**Missing context to add:**
- Brand voice guidelines
- Legal/compliance requirements
- Length restrictions for different platforms
- SEO keywords we need to include

### üéØ Success Criteria
**Ask yourself:** How will I know this prompt worked well?

**Current context:** [mostly missing]
**Missing context to add:**
- What action do we want customers to take?
- What questions should this answer?
- What objections should it overcome?

### üìö Relevant History
**Ask yourself:** What past experience should inform this?

**Current context:** [missing]
**Missing context to add:**
- What worked/didn't work in previous product launches?
- Customer feedback on similar products
- Lessons learned from competitor messaging

## Step 4: Enhanced Prompt Example

**Original Prompt:** 89 words of context

**Enhanced Prompt with Context Mining:**
```
Task: Write a product description for our new wireless earbuds.

Context: 
Situational Background: We're a mid-range electronics company launching our first audio product to compete in the $90-150 market gap. The market is dominated by premium ($180+) and budget ($30-60) options, leaving professionals wanting quality without luxury pricing.

Who's Involved: Targeting busy professionals aged 25-40 who commute, work in open offices, and take frequent calls. Our marketing team will adapt this for website, Amazon, and sales materials. Legal requires we avoid claims we can't prove.

Parameters & Constraints: Must include keywords "professional," "battery life," and "noise cancellation" for SEO. Cannot exceed 200 words for Amazon. Must maintain our brand voice: "reliable innovation for real people."

Success Criteria: Should address main objections (price vs. Apple, quality concerns, battery anxiety) and drive users to "Add to Cart." Must clearly communicate our value proposition of "premium features at practical prices."

Relevant History: Our previous tech products succeeded when we emphasized reliability over flashy features. Customer reviews consistently praise our customer service and build quality. Avoid overusing technical specs - our customers want benefits, not features.

**Enhanced Prompt:** 190 words of context (more than doubled!)

## Step 5: Test and Compare

1. **Run both prompts** with the same AI tool
2. **Compare the outputs** side by side
3. **Evaluate differences** using this checklist:

### Comparison Checklist:
- [ ] Which version better addresses your target audience?
- [ ] Which includes more relevant details?
- [ ] Which feels more authentic to your brand/situation?
- [ ] Which better handles potential objections?
- [ ] Which would be more useful for your actual business needs?
- [ ] Which demonstrates understanding of your constraints?

## Step 6: Group Discussion

**Share your results:**
1. **Which context category** added the most value to your prompt?
2. **What surprised you** about the differences in output?
3. **Which enhanced result** would you actually use in your business?
4. **What context** did you realize you take for granted but the AI needed?
