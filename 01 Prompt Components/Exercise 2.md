# Example Prompts Demonstrating Prompt Components

*These examples use a common business scenario that any audience can understand, showing how each prompt component dramatically improves the response quality and relevance.*

## 1) Task Only

```
Write about AI implementation in business.
```

**Expected Response:** A generic, unfocused response covering AI broadly. Could include anything from historical development to theoretical applications. No clear structure or specific actionable advice. Likely academic in tone and not targeted to any particular audience or use case.

---

## 2) Task + Context

```
Write about AI implementation in business.

Context: I'm a small business owner with 25 employees running a regional marketing agency. We're profitable but facing increased competition from larger firms. I've heard AI could help us compete better, but I have a limited budget and no technical staff. Most of our work involves creating marketing campaigns, managing client relationships, and producing content.
```

**Expected Response:** Now focused specifically on small business applications with practical, budget-conscious recommendations. Will address the specific challenges of a marketing agency and suggest relevant AI tools. Much more actionable and relevant to the business owner's actual situation.

## 3) Task + Context + Persona

```
Write about AI implementation in business.

Context: I'm a small business owner with 25 employees running a regional marketing agency. We're profitable but facing increased competition from larger firms. I've heard AI could help us compete better, but I have a limited budget and no technical staff. Most of our work involves creating marketing campaigns, managing client relationships, and producing content.

Persona: Respond as a seasoned business consultant who has helped dozens of small businesses successfully implement AI tools. You understand the challenges of limited budgets and non-technical teams. You're practical, results-focused, and speak from experience rather than theory.
```

**Expected Response:** Takes on the voice and expertise of an experienced consultant. Will include specific examples, realistic timelines, and acknowledge common obstacles. The advice becomes more credible and includes "I've seen this work" type insights. More conversational and confidence-building.

Persona: Respond as a seasoned business consultant who has helped dozens of small businesses successfully implement AI tools. You understand the challenges of limited budgets and non-technical teams. You're practical, results-focused, and speak from experience rather than theory.

Format: Organize your response as:
1. "Start Here" section (immediate first steps)
2. "Quick Wins" section (3 specific AI tools for marketing agencies)
3. "Implementation Timeline" (30/60/90-day plan)
4. "Budget Reality Check" (actual costs to expect)
5. "Red Flags to Avoid" (3 common mistakes)
```

**Expected Response:** Now highly structured and scannable. The business owner can quickly find the information most relevant to their immediate needs. Each section has a clear purpose and actionable content. Much easier to follow and implement.

Tone: Write in a confident, encouraging tone that acknowledges the challenges without being overwhelming. Use plain business language, avoid jargon, and include reassuring phrases like "you don't need to be technical to succeed with this." Be optimistic but realistic, and occasionally use "you" to speak directly to the reader.
```

**Expected Response:** Now combines all elements to create a highly tailored, engaging response. The tone makes the content approachable and builds confidence. The business owner feels understood and motivated rather than intimidated. The response reads like advice from a trusted advisor rather than a generic article.

## Key Differences You'll See:

- **Task Only:** Generic, unfocused, could apply to anyone
- **+ Context:** Becomes specific to marketing agencies and small business constraints  
- **+ Persona:** Gains credibility and practical experience-based insights
- **+ Format:** Becomes organized and actionable with clear next steps
- **+ Tone:** Becomes engaging and confidence-building, removing intimidation factor

This progression shows how each component transforms the same basic request into increasingly valuable, targeted guidance.
