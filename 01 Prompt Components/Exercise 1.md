## Exercise Option 1: Writing a Product Description

### Example Prompt Structure:

**Task:** Write a product description for our new wireless earbuds.

**Context:** 
I work for a mid-range electronics company targeting busy professionals aged 25-40. 
Our earbuds cost ($89), have 8-hour battery life, active noise cancellation, and quick-charge features. 
Our main competitors are Apple AirPods ($179) and Samsung Galaxy Buds ($149). 
We need to emphasize value and professional use cases. This will be used on our e-commerce website and Amazon listing.

**Format:** 
Structure the description as:
- Opening hook (1 sentence highlighting main benefit)
- Key features section (4 bullet points)
- Use case scenarios (2-3 brief examples)

## Exercise Option 2: Creating a Meeting Agenda

### Example Prompt Structure:

**Task:** Create a meeting agenda for our quarterly team review.

**Context:** I'm a marketing manager leading a team of 6 people. We need to review Q3 performance, discuss Q4 campaign planning, address budget concerns, and plan for upcoming product launches. The meeting is scheduled for 90 minutes next Tuesday at 2 PM. Attendees include team members from social media, content creation, and paid advertising. We've had issues with meetings running over time and people not being prepared.

**Format:** Create the agenda using this structure:
- Meeting header (date, time, duration, attendees)
- Pre-meeting preparation section (what people should bring)
- Timed agenda items with specific durations
- Action items section at the end
- Next meeting date placeholder
- Use bullet points and clear time allocations

### Try This Exercise:
1. Think of a meeting you need to plan (team check-in, project kickoff, etc.)
2. Build your Task + Context + Format prompt
3. Generate the agenda with AI
4. Refine based on what you get back

## Exercise Option 3: Drafting a Social Media Post

### Example Prompt Structure:

**Task:** Write a LinkedIn post announcing our company's new remote work policy.

**Context:** I'm the HR director at a 150-person software company. We're transitioning from hybrid (3 days office, 2 days remote) to fully flexible remote work starting January 1st. This is a competitive advantage for recruiting talent, but we want to emphasize that we're still maintaining company culture and collaboration. Our audience includes current employees, potential job candidates, and industry peers. We want to sound progressive but professional, and avoid seeming like we're just following trends.

**Format:** Structure the post as:
- Attention-grabbing opening line
- 2-3 paragraphs explaining the change and reasoning
- Include 2-3 relevant hashtags
- End with a question to encourage engagement
- Keep under 200 words total
- Professional but conversational tone

### Try This Exercise:
1. Pick a business update you could share (new service, team member, achievement, etc.)
2. Create your Task + Context + Format prompt
3. Generate the social media post
4. Test it on your actual social media or share with the group

## Group Discussion Questions:

After completing your exercise, discuss:

1. **What surprised you** about the AI's output?
2. **What would you change** about your prompt to get better results?
3. **Which component** (Task, Context, or Format) had the biggest impact on quality?
4. **How did your results compare** with others who chose the same task?
5. **What did you learn** about prompt construction?

## Extension Challenge:

Once you've mastered Task + Context + Format, try adding:
- **Persona**: Who should the AI "be" when writing this?
- **Tone**: What emotional quality should the content have?

See how these additional components further improve your results!
